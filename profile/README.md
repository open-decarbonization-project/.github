# Open Decarbonization Project

The Open Decarbonization Project (ODP) has been established to inspire the development of best-in-class methodologies supporting emissions quantification, abatement, and removal at scale for heavy industries and emissions removal projects. 

The ODP’s Open-Source approach is intended to support continuous peer review and feedback, with contributed artifacts administered under the MIT Open Source License, integrating the latest and most credible science based on current commercially available measurement technology. This collaborative ecosystem fosters the percolation of best practices and the standardization of methodologies through consensus, driving ongoing improvement and relevance in the project’s outputs.

The ODP’s intention is to welcome and solicit alternate science-based and measurement-based methodological approaches for carbon accounting of company or project emissions and emissions reduction activities.
