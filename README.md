# The Open Decarbonizaton Project

Open source projects on GitHub operate within a decentralized software development model
that encourages open collaboration. This approach allows for continuous peer review and
feedback, ensuring that the latest and most credible science is integrated with current
commercial sensing technology. The collaborative environment fosters the percolation of
best practices and the standardization of methodologies through consensus, driving ongoing
improvement and relevance in the projectâ€™s outputs.
